                        Iâ€™m a recent graduate at the University of California - Davis, with a Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I enjoy coding and love creativity. So with the combination of the two, I love frontend and UX/UI!
                        <br/><br/>
                        I had a year of experience as a UI/Frontend Web Developer Intern at UC Davis from July 2019 to October 2020. I love my work and do enjoy working. I want to extend my skills and knowledge by looking for a similar career.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I also love playing games, including video and board games. Also, sports like badminton and tennis.
