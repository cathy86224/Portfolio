          Davis.

          <br />I supported and developed several web-based applications and
          features for existing UC website and projects, such as the{" "}

          During the internship, my colleague, who focused on backend
          development, and I were determined to take on new challenges for
          ourselves. Fortunately, we were able to work on a new project (Carbon
          Neutrality Initiative Dashboard). My primary responsibility is to
          implement and design the frontend components.

          During those times, I collaborated with a backend colleague, product
          developer, and data teams weekly to ensure the project is going in the
          right direction. Critical teamwork skills I learned are to communicate
          well, actively listen, and be responsible and honest.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the end, we successfully developed the project from the ground up.
          Also, we were able to pass this project to another department to build
          on more features. It was the most accomplished project I've worked on
          during my internship experience.

          My internship experience has given me the skills to adjust to the
